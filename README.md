# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description
The objective is to create a social network API where users can share thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and create a friend list. This application
will be using Express.js for routing the API and MongoDB database to store the users, thoughts, and reactions. 

The application will have three models User, Thought, and Reaction. These models will contain the Schema that is needed to create the models. Also for the routing for each model, the routes should contain GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT routes in order to find, create, update, and delete. 

## Technology Used
- Express.js
- MongoDB
